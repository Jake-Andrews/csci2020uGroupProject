Rules - If the dealer and the player have the same score, the dealer wins. The dealer and player can only hit 3 times. 

2. How to run. 
Git clone the repository. 
Open the Client and Server folders separately. Open another client folder so you can run two clients.

The server and clients can be run from the command line using gradle run or through a IDEA that has support for gradle, IntelliJ was used in the creation of this project.
